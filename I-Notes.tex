outer radiation belt extends from an altitude of about three to ten Earth radii, and is characterised by a relatively high density of high energy (0.1-10~MeV) electrons trapped within Earth's magnetosphere. The density varies wildly based on geomagnetic storms and variations in solar wind.
much more worrying is the inner belt which extends from an altitude of 100~km (the edge of space) to about 10,000~km, and consists of high concentrations of energetic protons (some over 400~MeV, which can penetrate 143~mm of lead) thought to be caused by cosmic ray collisions with nuclei of the upper atmosphere.

reaction wheels for attitude control; at the moment no external thrusters for attitude control. It has been suggested to use the PPTs for reaction wheel desaturation, although they can only remove pitch and yaw, not roll.

\enquote{While the lunar orbit in DE 421 is close to that in DE 418, it is a major improvement over the widely distributed DE 405 (Standish 1998). For DE 405 the lunar orbit was not fit in a way consistent with the other planets}\cite{DE421}.

third body forces from Jupiter barycenter

The geographic parameters of satellite radius $r$, longitude $\lambda$ and latitude $\phi$ are calculated by converting the ECI frame to a body-fixed frame. The conversion is provided by the International Earth Rotation Service \parencite{Petit2010}.

Define J2000 frame and epoch

The IERS Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) is offset from the J2000 reference frame (equivalent to EME 2000) by a small rotation:  the J2000 pole offset magnitude is about 18 milliarcseconds (mas) and the equinox offset magnitude is approximately 78 milliarcseconds (see [3]). \url{http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/GRAIL/kernels/fk/moon_080317.tf}

The ITRF93 high accuracy Earth rotation model takes into account:
\begin{itemize}
\item Precession: 1976 IAU model due to Lieske.
\item  Nutation: 1980 IAU model, with IERS corrections due to Herring et al.
\item  True sidereal time using accurate values of TAI-UT1
\item  Polar motion
\end{itemize}



backwards propagation allows optimisation of mass - once final dry mass is known, can propagate backwards to determine how much wet mass is required.


\cite{Yam2011} attempts global search using basin hopping and simulated annealing, each hybridized with a local search algorithm. Has to approximate the low thrust maneouvre as a series of impulsive maneouvers.

homotopy/embedding/continuation methods: optimise a simplified case (two body problem), then use that solution as the initial guess for a more sophisticated case, etc.

SOCS implements a sparse SQP method based on a Schur-complement algorithm suggested by Gill et al. (Stanford technical papers)
Jacobian and Hessian matrices are computed efficiently using sparse finite differencing as proposed by Coleman1983 SIAM journal of numerical analysis and Curtis1974 Journal of the Institute of Mathematics and Applications

No DOF : number of parameters minus active constraints. Approx 50,000 for Cruise phase
Cond KKT system: condition number of Hessian matrix of Lagrangian, from Newton's method: $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ where $A$ is the Hessian, $\vec{x}$ is the system and $\vec{b}$ represents the perturbations. A high condition number means the system is highly sensitive to small changes in the perturbation vector. Approx 1e11

SOCS uses BFGS quasi-Netwon method to approximate Hessian (Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb, Schanno).
