	arcjet thruster of the lunar mission Bw1 concluded in the necessity
	that the pressure regulator of the propellant feed system needs to
	be modified to reach a higher pressure level inside the propellant
	feed system. The mass flow rate showed fluctuations of 15%, which
	are not acceptable for stable arcjet operation. To sustain a high
	temperature behind the vaporizer the propellant feed system is insulated
	by use of space blankets wrapped around the pipings. A new vaporizer
	concept is developed increasing the heat transfer into the ammonia
	by use of stainless steel srub inside the vaporizer. The necessary
	heating power for complete vaporization is calculated to be 50 W.
	The results of the tests with the modiflcated propellant feed system
	show that first the fluctuations of the mass flow rate disappear
	by use of the modified pressure regulator. Secondly, the higher pressure
	level is reached but the mass flow is to high. Consequently, the
	diameter of the flow aperture has to be decreased.},

	satellite developed by three graduate students: A cubical laboratory
	satellite, named ILSE, with an edge length of about 50 cm was developed
	for testing purposes. ILSE is a full working model with similar functionality
	as the future flying prototype. To allow a development timeframe
	of less than one year, mostly standard commercial off-the-shelf components
	(i.e. non-space-qualified parts) are used. Since the laboratory satellite
	needs to be fully autonomous and without any external connection
	it has to contain its own power source. The power source consists
	of three solar panels of which two are deployable. Furthermore the
	satellite is equipped with three video cameras (visible, NIR and
	TIR) and a high resolution digital CCD photo camera for Earth Observation.
	ILSE is controlled from its on-board computer and communicates with
	the ground via a telemetry and telecommand radio link. For acquisition
	of image sequences the video signal can be recorded. The transmission
	is conducted with the ground station via a separate high bandwidth
	analog radio link. To simulate target pointing and attitude movement
	in general, ILSE is capable of being fully rotated around the azimuth

	to 9.2 &mu;m and at 10.4 to 12.6 &mu;m. The attitude control system
	of the satellite permits arbitrary pointing angles. This combination
	of bi-spectral camera system and multi-angle observation capability
	offers means of improving land surface temperature retrieval. In
	order to investigate the utility of the prospective observations,
	data has been modelled numerically for a wide range of atmospheric
	properties, using the radiation transport model MODTRAN. The resulting
	data was analysed statistically and a number of algorithms for temperature
	retrieval have been derived, depending on available angles. The multi-angle
	method improves accuracy of the retrieved temperature compared to
	the employment of the split-window method only, especially for very
	humid atmospheres. A standard deviation below one Kelvin can be achieved
	for land surface temperature.},

	published in a book. A CD-ROM data base is attached to the book.
	For this paper these data have been used for a very first statistical
	synopsis. The measurement results of different scientists for similar
	targets and similar geometric conditions differ partly to a great
	extent. Hence mean values and variances cannot presently be used
	to describe the BRDF of different surfaces. The anisotropy factor
	defined by Sandmeier seems appropriate to be used in some investigations.
	The data sets are not sufficient for serious statistical analyses.
	Further measurements are essential to overcome the gap from examples
	to confidential statistical evaluations. In the last section the
	measurement methods planned by the University of Stuttgart for a
	ground measuring device and by target pointing of a small satellite
	are discussed.},

	for the all-electric satellite Lunar Mission BW1, proposed by the
	Institute for Space Systems (IRS) at the University of Stuttgart.
	Mission constraints and design compromises have imposed many severe
	non-linearities on the thrust profile. For example, reaction wheel
	desaturation and groundstation access limit the times available for
	thrusting, while limited battery capacity constrains the thrust duration
	before an idle period for recharging is needed. Furthermore, the
	long transit time resulting from using an electric propulsion system
	magnifies the effects of small perturbing forces acting on the spacecraft
	which are usually neglected in other trajectory studies. To overcome
	these difficulties a non-linear programming approach was utilised,
	exploiting state-of-the-art optimal control software developed by
	Boeing. The flight dynamics, cost function, path and boundary constraints
	were carefully modelled such that they appear as linear parameters
	to the optimisation interface, allowing the independent and combined
	effects of each constraint to be investigated. Preliminary results
	of this optimisation are presented, with a discussion of sensitivity
	analysis to ensure robustness in the event of subsystem failure or
	off-nominal conditions.},

	At the end of its primary science mission, it will perform a controlled

	a numerical simulation and optimization of possible impact trajectories
	starting from the satellite's initial 100 km polar, circular orbit.
	The perturbing accelerations being in the same order of magnitude
	as the thrust, we used thrust vector control for efficient orbit
	manipulation. First results show that an impact using the electrical
	thrusters is principally feasible. Using the 6 mN thrusters by themselves
	for the deorbit maneuver is unadvisable due to the long thrust durations
	and the very low impact angle, making the impact inaccurate and difficult
	to control. The 100 mN thruster, however, together with an additional
	solid rocket motor for a final aposelene boost, yields much more
	favorable impact conditions at the price of a higher subsystem mass.},

	plan along with common-sense considerations. Specific strategies
	are presented which allow to accomplish the mission requirements
	within the given constraints. The paper gives the break-down of QSAT
	lifetime into specific phases and cycles, and the allocation of the
	defined modes. Only about 32 minutes of ground-station visibility
	are available per day, thus only about 2 Mbytes of data can be downlinked

	short-pulsed coaxial plasma accelerators for space propulsion are
	being developed and experimentally investigated. Pulsed plasma thrusters
	(PPT) are of particular interest for space exploration and exploitation
	since they essentially combine the advantage of continuously operated
	high-power magnetoplasmadynamic thrusters with low average electric
	power consumption and manageable heat generation. This available-power
	capacity and their ability of generating high specific impulses makes
	them especially well suited for planetary missions using small satellites.
	Hence at IRS, a program has been initiated to build and launch its
	own series of self-propelled micro-satellites for technology development
	as well as planetary scientific exploration. For a projected Moon
	mission, the spacecraft starting from a typical 200&times;35800 km
	GTO will use its onboard PPT-based propulsion system to fly towards
	and insert itself into a 100 km altitude polar orbit around the Moon.
	Low-thrust PPTs are required to be continuously operated throughout
	the whole transfer and, thus, discrete-impulse trajectory concepts,
	known from lunar spacecrafts with high-thrust chemical engines, can
	no longer be used for propulsion system design. Moreover, there exists
	a region between Earth and Moon where their respective gravitational
	attractions are approximately of equal magnitude and where the spacecraft
	trajectory is expected to be very sensitive to small perturbations
	and may even become chaotic. The propulsion system for such a mission
	has to be conceived by taking into account these points which appear
	to be particularly important for low-thrust trajectories. The first
	results of these investigations indicating that such a lunar exploration
	mission is technically feasible with the help of a cluster of four
	PPTs and one low-power arcjet will be presented and discussed. Copyright

	A utilisation of this technology suggests itself which considers

	the application range also to large aircraft, space stations and
	suchlike. The signals generated on this basis are usable both for
	vehicle guidance and for structural control. The key element of such
	a generalisation is the kinematical model describing the vehicle
	motion: Until now, the mentioned restriction to rigid bodies is regular
	and considers only inertial sensors referring to a single vehicle
	point. A more general navigation system design considers, however,
	a specific model comprising additional degrees of freedom from structural
	distortions as well as spatially distributed sensors. This model
	is employed within an extended Kalman filter estimating the vehicle
	motion state of high resolution regarding time. In addition, the
	filter uses the signals of gyros, accelerometers, satellite navigation
	receivers, and structural sensors. For this purpose, the paper discusses
	firstly different variants of integrated navigation systems followed
	by a presentation of the advantage of spatially distributing satellite
	navigation antennas over the vehicle structure. Finally, the integrated
	system for a simple flexible aircraft structure is introduced. &copy;
