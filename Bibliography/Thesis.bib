	method for the solution of Hamiltonian systems. We test our implementations
	on Kepler's problem with the aim of judging the algorithms' qualitative
	behavior and efficiency. In particular, we introduce compensated
	summation as a method of controlling roundoff accumulation. Also,
	we show how the variable step size Gauss implicit Runge-Kutta method
	performs on Kepler's problem with solution orbits of high eccentricity,
	and compare its performance with that of two Runge-Kutta-Nystrom
	codes. Finally, we discuss the calculation of efficient starting
	values for the associated iterations, measure the cost in iterations
	of our various predictors, and comment on the strategies for terminating
	the iteration. &copy; 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The current standard theory of the origin of the Moon is that Earth
	was hit by a giant impactor the size of Mars, causing ejection of
	iron-poor impactor mantle debris that coalesced to form the Moon.
	But where did this Mars-sized impactor come from? Isotopic evidence
	suggests that it came from 1 AU radius in the solar nebula, and computer
	simulations are consistent with its approaching Earth on a zero-energy
	parabolic trajectory. But how could such a large object form in the
	disk of planetesimals at 1 AU without colliding with Earth early
	on, before having a chance to grow large or before its or Earth's
	iron core had formed? We propose that the giant impactor could have
	formed in a stable orbit among debris at Earth's L4 (or L5) Lagrange
	point. We show that such a configuration is stable, even for a Mars-sized
	impactor. It could grow gradually by accretion at L4 (or L5), but
	eventually gravitational interactions with other growing planetesimals
	could kick it out into a chaotic creeping orbit, which we show would
	likely cause it to hit Earth on a zero-energy parabolic trajectory.
	We argue that this scenario is possible and should be further studied.},

  abstract = {The direct transcription or collocation method has demonstrated notable
	success in the solution of trajectory optimization and optimal control
	problems. This approach combines a sparse nonlinear programming algorithm
	with a discretization of the trajectory dynamics. A challenging class
	of optimization problems occurs when the spacecraft trajectories

	the vehicle weight. Low-thrust trajectories are demanding because
	realistic forces due to oblateness, aerodynamic drag, and third-body
	perturbions often dominate the thrust. Furthermore because the thrust
	is so low, significant changes to the orbits require very long duration
	trajectories. When a collocation method is applied to a problem of
	this type, the resulting nonlinear program is very large because
	the trajectories are long, and very nonlinear because of the perturbing
	forces. This paper describes the application of the transcription
	method to the solution of very low-thrust orbit transfers. The vehicle

  title = {Trajectory Design, Optimisation and Guidance for Reusable Launch
	Vehicles During the Terminal Area Flight Phase},
  school = {School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Adelaide},
  year = {2007},
  abstract = {The next generation of reusable launch vehicles (RLVs) require significant
	improvements in guidance methods in order to reduce cost, increase
	safety and flexibility, whilst allowing for possible autonomous operation.
	Research has focused on the ascent and hypersonic re-entry flight
	phases. This thesis presents a new method for trajectory design,
	optimisation and guidance of RLVs during the terminal area flight
	phases. The terminal area flight phase is the transitional phase
	from hypersonic re-entry to the approach and landing phase. The trajectory
	design, optimisation and guidance methods within this thesis are
	an evolution of previous work conducted on the ascent and re-entry
	flight phases of RLVs. The methods are modified to incorporate the
	terminal area flight phase through the adaption of the problem definition
	and the inclusion of the speed brake setting as a steering parameter.
	The methods discussed and developed in this thesis are different
	to previous methods for the terminal area flight phase as they encompass
	optimisation, trajectory design and guidance based on the definition
	of the steering parameters. The NLPQL nonlinear optimiser contained
	within the International Mathematics Standards Library (IMSL) is
	utilised for trajectory design and optimisation. Real-time vehicle
	guidance is achieved using the restoration steps of an accelerated
	Gradient Projection Algorithm (GPA). The methods used are evaluated
	in a three degrees of freedom (3DOF) simulation environment. To properly
	evaluate the programs and gain a better understanding of the terminal
	area flight phase, two different vehicles are utilised within this
	study. These vehicles are the German sub-orbital Hopper concept vehicle,
	a previously proposed replacement for the Ariane series of launch
	vehicles and the recently cancelled joint National Aeronautics and
	Space Administration (NASA) and Lockheed Martin sub-orbital test
	bed vehicle, X-33. The two vehicles each have a terminal area flight
	phase, but their mission profiles and vehicle characteristics are
	significantly different. The Hopper vehicle is a winged re-entry
	vehicle, whereas the X-33 vehicle is a lifting body. The trajectory
	design method takes into account the initial and final conditions,
	in-flight restrictions such as dynamic pressure and vehicle loads
	as well as safety margins. The designed trajectories are evaluated
	to analyse the terminal area flight phase and to assist in the development
	of the guidance program. The guidance method is evaluated utilising
	an program consisting of two parts, a real world simulator with high
	order models and a representation of the on-board guidance computer,
	the predictor, which uses low order models for computational efficiency.
	The guidance method is evaluated against a variety of off-nominal
	conditions to account for dispersions within the high order real
	world models and common errors experienced by re-entry vehicles.
	These off-nominal conditions include atmospheric disturbances, winds,
	aerodynamic, mass, navigation, steering and initial condition errors.
	The results of this study include a detailed analysis of the terminal
	area flight phase highlighting the major influences for vehicle and
	trajectory design. The study also confirms the applicability of the
	non-linear programming method utilising the vehicle steering parameters
	as a viable option for trajectory design and guidance. A comparison
	to other available results highlights the strengths and weaknesses
	of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Searching optimal interplanetary trajectories for low-thrust spacecraft
	is usually a difficult and time-consuming task that involves much
	experience and expert knowledge in astrodynamics and optimal control

	optimizers, which are based on numerical optimal control methods,
	depends on an adequate initial guess, which is often hard to find,
	especially for very-low-thrust trajectories that necessitate many
	revolutions around the sun. The obtained solutions are typically
	close to the initial guess that is rarely close to the (unknown)
	global optimum. Within this paper, trajectory optimization problems
	are attacked from the perspective of artificial intelligence and

	method for low-thrust trajectory optimization is proposed that fuses
	artificial neural networks and evolutionary algorithms into so-called
	evolutionary neurocontrollers. This novel method runs without an
	initial guess and does not require the attendance of an expert in

	An analysis is performed of the system trajectories as obtained when

	impact on the moon and 2) moon orbit injection. The solution for
	both cases is obtained by considering the gravity field of one body
	at a time. The initial Earth-centered trajectory consists of a number
	of revolutions during which the trajectory spirals away gradually
	from Earth. In the impact case, by adequately choosing the guidance
	parameter, it is possible to achieve, at a prescribed range, a moon-relative
	velocity such that the moon gravitational field will capture the
	spacecraft. For moon orbit injection, the trajectory is obtained
	by matching the outward Earth-spiral trajectory with a moon inward

	parameter positive for the Earth outward spiral and negative for
	the moon inward one.},

	of 1 mm/s<sup>2</sup> or less, four or more decimal orders below
	orbital gravity accelerations. This implies very long inter-orbital
	maneuvers counting many hundreds of revolutions. Any straightforward
	numerical method of thrust optimization, quite successful in deep
	space trajectory design, is doomed to fail when applied to trajectories
	this long. A practical approach is use of thrust-to-gravity ratio
	as a small parameter. When dealing with quadratic quality criteria
	such as fuel consumption, this approach leads to splitting the problem
	into a sequence of two Optimal Control problems, corresponding to
	`fast' and `flow' time. The strategy has much in common with the
	averaging methods widely used in Celestial Mechanics. Its implementation
	is based on the use of the two sets of osculating elements, which
	describe the orbit and the thrust program, respectively. The latter
	one is considered as a control vector. Both sets obey the differential
	equations derived from the Maximum Principle. Their structure is
	well adapted to averaging over an orbital period. The procedure eliminates
	the fast time, i.e. filters out the oscillatory terms with this period
	from the osculating elements and leaves the slow secular changes
	untouched. Averaging simplifies the problem so much as to make it
	solvable numerically. Efficient quadrature formulae were developed
	supplying exact numerical values as well as convenient semi-analytical
	representation to the integrals that appear in the averaging process.
	The averaged (secular, slow time) problem actually constructs an
	optimal end-to-end trajectory as an optimal concatenation of a set
	of locally optimal arcs built at the previous phase. Pontryagin's
	principle reduces the optimization problem to a two-point boundary
	value problem. An algorithm designed to solve this TPBVP was developed.
	A representative sample transfer trajectory is presented as an illustration

	of low-thrust propulsion systems. As these planets are decidedly
	oblate, the question of the effect of that oblateness on a low-thrust
	trajectory is of some interest. In this paper the problem of optimal
	energy increase is attacked under the assumption that the coefficients
	for the second zonal harmonic, i.e.,J2, and the nondimensional thrust
	acceleration are the same order of magnitude. Using a two variable
	asymptotic expansion technique, a near optimal control program is
	generated and the first order uniformly valid approximation for the
	corresponding trajectory is obtained. Tangential thrust is shown
	to be a good near-optimal thrust program even in the presence of
	oblateness effects. The optimal control program is found to be oscillatory
	and quite similar to the optimal control for energy increase in an
	inverse square gravitational field.},

	New mission concepts are increasingly considering the use of ion
	thrusters for fuel-efficient navigation in deep space. This paper
	presents parallel, evolutionary computing methods to design trajectories
	of spacecraft propelled by ion thrusters and assesses the trade-off
	between delivered payload mass and required flight time. The developed
	methods utilize a distributed computing environment in order to speed
	up computation, and use evolutionary algorithms to find globally
	Paretooptimal solutions. The methods are coupled with two main traditional
	trajectory design approaches, which are called direct and indirect.
	In the direct approach, thrust control is discretized in either arc
	time or arc length, and the resulting discrete thrust vectors are
	optimized. In the indirect approach, the thrust control problem is
	transformed into a co-state control problem and the initial values
	of the co-state vector are optimized. The developed methods are applied
	to two problems: 1) an orbit transfer around the Earth and 2) a transfer
	between two distance retrograde orbits around Europa, the icy Galilean
	moon closest to Jupiter. The optimal solutions found with the present
	methods are comparable to other state-of-the-art trajectory optimizers,
	while the required computation time is often several orders of magnitude
	less thanks to an intelligent design of control vector discretization,
	advanced algorithmic parameterization, and parallel computing. Copyright

	satellite providers for on-orbit station keeping due to the total
	life cycle cost advantages these systems offer. NASA has also sought
	to benefit from the use of EP for primary propulsion onboard the
	Deep Space–1 and DAWN spacecraft. These applications utilized EP
	systems based on gridded ion thrusters, which offer performance unequaled
	by other electric propulsion thrusters. Through the In-Space Propulsion
	Project, a lower cost thruster technology is currently under development
	designed to make electric propulsion intended for primary propulsion
	applications cost competitive with chemical propulsion systems. The
	basis for this new technology is a very reliable electric propulsion
	thruster called the Hall thruster. Hall thrusters, which have been
	flown by the Russians dating back to the 1970’s, have been used by
	the Europeans on the SMART-1 lunar orbiter and currently employed
	by fifteen other geostationary spacecraft. Since the inception of
	the Hall thruster, over 100 of these devices have been used with
	no known failures. This paper describes the latest accomplishments
	of a development task that seeks to improve Hall thruster technology
	by increasing its specific impulse, throttle-ability, and lifetime
	to make this type of electric propulsion thruster applicable to NASA
	deep space science missions. In addition to discussing recent progress
	on this task, this paper describes the performance and cost benefits
	projected to result from the use of advanced Hall thrusters for deep

  abstract = {Recent advances in the area of gradient algorithms for optimal control
	problems are summarized, with particular emphasis on the work performed
	by the staff of the Aero-Astronautics Group of Rice University. The
	following basic problem is considered: minimize a functional I which
	depends on the state x(t), the control u(t), and the parameter pi
	. Here, I is a scalar, x an n-vector, u an m-vector, and pi a p-vector.
	At the initial point, the state is prescribed. At the final point,
	the state x and the parameter pi are required to satisfy q scalar
	relations. Along the interval of integration, the state, the control,
	and the parameter are required to satisfy n scalar differential equations.
	First, the sequential gradient - restoration algorithm and the combined
	gradient - restoration algorithm are presented. Next, a family of
	gradient - restoration algorithms is introduced. Not only does this
	family include the previous two algorithms as particular cases, but
	it allows one to generate several additional algorithms, namely,
	those with alternate restoration and optional restoration. Then two
	modifications of the sequential gradient - restoration algorithm
	are presented in an effort to accelerate terminal convergence. Next,
	the addition of a nondifferential constraint, to be satisfied everywhere
	along the interval of integration, is considered. Finally, the simultaneous
	presence of nondifferential constraints and multiple subarcs is considered.
	The paper ends with a section dealing with transformation techniques.},

	By the latter we mean the difference between the computed orbit and
	the dynamical behaviour of the real physical system, whatever the
	causes. The analysis of these causes requires an interdisciplinary
	effort: there are physical model and parameters errors, algorithm
	and discretisation errors, rounding off errors and reliability problems
	in the computer hardware and system software, as well as instabilities
	in the dynamical system. We list all the sources of integration error
	we are aware of and discuss their relevance in determining the present
	limit to the time span of a meaningful integration of the orbit of
	the planets. At present this limit is of the order of 108 years for
	the outer planets. We discuss in more detail the truncation error
	of multistep algorithms (when applied to eccentric orbits), the coefficient
	error, the method of Encke and the associated coordinate change error,
	the procedures used to test the numerical integration software and
	their limitations. Many problems remain open, including the one of
	a realistic statistical model of the rounding off error; at present,

	its application to two weapon scenarios. The first was an air-to-air
	missile terminal homing scenario. Assuming ideal sensor information
	and a single-lag missile response model, the guidance was shown to
	perform well against an air target performing evasive maneuvers.
	A specified zero-aspect terminal encounter angle was achieved while
	simultaneously minimizing miss distance. The second application involved
	an air-to-surface munition released from an unmanned air vehicle.
	The GENEX guidance law was able to produce trajectories satisfying
	a terminal impact angle constraint. In addition, an engagement region
	of sufficient size was shown to be achievable using guidance gains
	scheduled with target location and weapon release altitude.},

	global trajectory optimisation competition are presented and the

	been somewhat bounded based on prior mission-design experience, intuition,
	and energy arguments. A shape-based method is used to represent the
	low-thrust arcs, while the ballistic portions are searched almost
	exhaustively. The second step involves local optimisation of trajectories
	which stand out from the rough global search. The low-thrust optimisation
	problem is turned into a parameter optimisation problem by approximating
	the continuous thrusting as a series of impulsive manoeuvres. Of
	the many trajectories found, three optimal trajectories are reported
	and compared, including the one submitted for the competition. The

	for complex orbit transfer missions with low-thrust propulsion system,
	which minimizes the drawbacks of traditional optimization methods,
	such as bad convergence, difficulty of initial guesses and local
	optimality. Design/methodology/approach - First, the trajectory optimization
	problem comes down to a nonlinear constraint parameter optimization
	by using the concept of traditional hybrid method. Then, one utilizes
	genetic algorithm (GA) to solve this parameter optimization problem
	after treating the constraints with the simulated annealing (SA)
	and randompenalty function. Finally, one makes use of localized optimization
	to improve the precision of the final solutions. Findings - This
	algorithm not only keeps the advantages of traditional hybrid method
	such as high precision and smooth solutions, but also inherits the
	merits of GA which could avoid initial guess work and obtain a globally
	optimal solution. Research limitations/implications -Further, research
	is required to reduce the computational complexity when the transfer
	trajectory is very complex and/or has many adjustable variables.
	Practical implications - By using this method, the globally optimal
	solutions of some complex missions, which could not be obtained by
	traditional method, could be found. Originality/value - This method
	combines the GA with traditional hybrid method, and utilizes SA and
	random penalty functions to treat with constraints, and then gives
	out a super convergence way to find the globally optimal low-thrust
	transfer orbit.},

  pages = {1243-1251},

  abstract = {The design of a spacecraft trajectory can be formulated as a global
	optimization task. The complexity of the resulting problem depends
	greatly on the final target planet, the chosen spacecraft intermediate
	route, and the type of engine and power system available on-board.
	Few attempts have been made to directly use a global optimization
	framework to design trajectories that make use of low-thrust propulsion
	because of the large scale and extreme complexity of the resulting
	non-linear programming problem. The presence of non-convex constraints,
	in particular, requires the use of solvers able to deal with such
	an added complexity. Here, the Sims–Flanagan transcription method
	is proposed to model the low-thrust trajectory design as a constrained
	global optimization problem. Then, two different solvers are applied:
	basin hopping and simulated annealing with adaptive neighbourhood.
	Both algorithms are hybridized with a local search. Two different
	interplanetary trajectories are considered: an Earth–Earth–Jupiter
	transfer with a nuclear electric propulsion spacecraft inspired by
	the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter and a transfer to Mercury inspired
	by the BepiColombo mission. For both problems, the proposed approach
	proves to be able to explore automatically the vast solution space,
	producing a large number of trajectories in a large range of final
	mass and flight times, proving the possibility to apply global optimization
	techniques directly to the low-thrust problem.},

  abstract = {The optimization of the Earth-moon trajectory using solar electric
	propulsion is presented. A feasible method is proposed to optimize
	the transfer trajectory starting from a low Earth circular orbit
	(500 km altitude) to a low lunar circular orbit (200 km altitude).
	Due to the use of low-thrust solar electric propulsion, the entire
	transfer trajectory consists of hundreds or even thousands of orbital
	revolutions around the Earth and the moon. The Earth-orbit ascending
	(from low Earth orbit to high Earth orbit) and lunar descending (from
	high lunar orbit to low lunar orbit) trajectories in the presence
	of J <sub>2</sub> perturbations and shadowing effect are computed
	by an analytic orbital averaging technique. A direct/indirect method
	is used to optimize the control steering for the trans-lunar trajectory
	segment, a segment from a high Earth orbit to a high lunar orbit,
	with a fixed thrust-coast-thrust engine sequence. For the trans-lunar
	trajectory segment, the equations of motion are expressed in the
	inertial coordinates about the Earth and the moon using a set of
	nonsingular equinoctial elements inclusive of the gravitational forces
	of the sun, the Earth, and the moon. By way of the analytic orbital
	averaging technique and the direct/indirect method, the Earth-moon
	transfer problem is converted to a parameter optimization problem,
	and the entire transfer trajectory is formulated and optimized in
	the form of a single nonlinear optimization problem with a small
	number of variables and constraints. Finally, an example of an Earth-moon
	transfer trajectory using solar electric propulsion is demonstrated.},
