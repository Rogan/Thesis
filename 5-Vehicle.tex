\section{Power}\label{sec:Vehicle-power}

\subsection{Power generation} \label{sub:Power-generation}

At the commencement of this project, it was anticipated that power would be one of the defining factors in determining an optimal trajectory. Consequently power was implemented as one of the states to be tracked during optimisation. The power generation was calculated using equation \eqref{eq:Power-generation},
\begin{gather} \label{eq:Power-generation}
P = Q\times A_{eff}\times\eta_a\times\eta_c\times\eta_{DC}\times\cos\Psi_\Sun\times\mathfrak{R}
\end{gather}
where $Q$ represents the solar intensity near the Earth-Moon system, $\eta_a$ represents the area efficiency of the solar cells arranged within the panel, $\eta_c$ represents the solar cell efficiency, and $\eta_{DC}$ represents the efficiency of the voltage regulator. The angle subtended by the sun on the solar panels is $\Psi_\Sun$, and the power degradation is $\mathfrak{R}$.

The solar intensity is calculated by dividing the average solar luminosity \parencite[$3.846\times10^{26}$ W,][]{Montenbruck2000} by the surface area of a sphere with radius equal to the Earth's distance from the Sun ($4\pi r_\Sun^2$). This is important because the Earth's distance from the Sun varies by 6\% over the year \parencite{Montenbruck2000}. The solar intensity is then multiplied by the effective area of the solar panels, $A_{eff}$. Although the spacecraft has 6~m$^2$ of panels, because the central two panels are positioned at 45\degrees\ the effective area is only 5.4~m$^2$.

Based on the latest design work by my colleague Alexander Uryu, the area efficiency is about 0.8, that is, only 80\% of the effective solar panel area will actually be covered in solar cells, due to the geometric arrangement of the cells and the additional surface area required for circuitry. The solar cells will be state-of-the-art TEC-STAR GaAs/InP 34 series solar arrays with 200~$\mu$m front cover glass and 500~$\mu$m back cover glass. Consequently it is estimated that the cell efficiency will be about 27\% at launch. The exact power control circuitry is not yet known, but based on modern power conversion ciruits it is expected that the DC voltage regulator will be approximately 85\% efficient. 

It is assumed that while one axis of the solar panels is constrained to the thrust vector, the other is free to rotate about the thrust vector to obtain the best sun angle possible. Consequently the sun angle can be calculated using equation \eqref{eq:sun-angle}.
\begin{gather} \label{eq:sun-angle}
\vec{u}\cdot\vec{r}_\Sun = |\vec{u}|.|\vec{r}_\Sun|\cos\Psi \\
\Psi = \arccos\frac{\vec{u}\cdot\vec{r}_\Sun}{|\vec{u}|.|\vec{r}_\Sun|}
\end{gather}

The greatest unknown in the power model is how much the solar cells will degrade over time. As \textcite{Erb_thesis} points out, the solar panel degradation is directly related to total equivalent \enquote{fluence}, $\mathfrak{F}$ (that is, the radiation dose received), which must be integrated over the transfer, where the derivative with respect to time $\frac{d\mathfrak{F}}{dt}$ is approximated as a function of the distance from Earth, as shown in \autoref{fig:Fluence}. 

\begin{figure}

\def\svgwidth{\figurewidth}
\input{Images/fluence.pdf_tex}
\caption{Radiation fluence during a 24 hour orbit as a function of distance from Earth.}
\label{fig:Fluence}
\end{figure}
  
At each time step the equivalent radiation dose of a 24~hour orbit at that distance from the Earth may be taken from the graph, and scaled to the time interval. This effective radiation dose is added to the accumulated radiation dose. The total accumulated radiation dose may be translated to a power degradation factor using \autoref{fig:Fluence2}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\def\svgwidth{\figurewidth}
\input{Images/fluence2.pdf_tex}
\caption{Power degradation as a consequence of radiation fluence.}
\label{fig:Fluence2}
\end{figure}

Data for the panel degradation model was based on the work done by \textcite{Hechler2002} during planning for the SMART-1 mission. During the SMART-1 mission, it was found that their solar cells degraded by approximately 0.12\% per day, or about 2~W \parencite{Racca5}. It was also found that during the solar storm that occurred during the transfer, an additional 1\% panel degradation occurred \parencite{Racca8}. However, soon after the solar storm, the spacecraft reached a periapsis of 11790~km whereupon no further radiation damage occurred. Thus it can be assumed that the phase boundary defined in the mission architecture may be quite conservative, which should be factored into further power degredation modelling if not simply changing the mission architecture.

\subsection{Power consumption} \label{sub:Power-consumption}

At each timestep the power required for communications and the power required by the payload would be subtracted from the power generated. At this stage in the mission planning, the payload is not confirmed and the satellite communications have not been determined due to pending agreements with ground station providers in Australia, Japan and the USA. However, it is expected that most of the payload will be in standby until the spacecraft is confirmed in the science orbit, so power requirements during the transfer will be minimal. Thruster power is also subtracted from generated power (see \autoref{sec:Propulsion}).

Any surplus power generated by the solar panels is added to the battery level, or any remaining deficit is subtracted from them. According to the initial design stated by \textcite{Falke2004}, the lithium ion batteries were designed to hold 100~Ah supplying a common bus of 28~V. It is assumed the batteries will be fully charged at launch. At any stage during the transfer, if the batteries become fully charged the spacecraft will roll around its thrust vector to point the solar panels away from the Sun, to prevent overcharge.

modelled around apoapsis for first phase (objective is to raise periapsis outside VABs - apoapsis is already outside)

modelled around periapsis for second phase (objective is to raise orbital energy - Oberth effect means more delta V is gained by burning at low altitude).

optimisable fixed-body thrust vector allows trade-off between thrust angle and solar panel orientation - if the craft isn't thrusting, it can still use the thrust vector controls to point the solar panels at the sun


The length of this phase frequently resulted in computational difficulty, so a number of design compromises were investigated to solve the problem (it is acknowledged by the author that changing hardware design to make the simulation easier is a poor design philosophy, but the project management was interested to know the effects of these changes regardless of any simulation difficulties). For example, a design configuration was being investigated with 6 PPTs rather than 4, thereby increasing the available thrust without losing $I_{sp}$. The trade-off with this change is the additional thrusters would increase the dry mass of the vehicle, decreasing available payload. A similar design change was investigating the pulse rate of the PPTs. A higher pulse frequency increases thrust, increases mass flow, and increases power consumption, but impulse is conserved. However, an additional unknown is introduced: the heat flux within the electrodes is increased. 

can cause damage to electrodes, decrease operational lifetime - important on a 4 year mission! there is literature indicating that some designs can tolerate higher heat flux (cite Russian study) but further testing of the SIMPLEX would be required.


variable thrust magnitude - arcjet model mass flow rate + power?

PPTs is pulse frequency. Assuming we can run at 3~Hz, maximum thrust is increased.... change whole model?!?

Modelling with initial values of PPT frequency = 1~Hz, computational issues due to transfer being too long. Noticed that the power was a huge surplus, so spoke to the PPT experts (Matthias) who indicated that extra power could be pushed into higher pulse rate on the PPTs, up to 3~Hz. Remodelled based on this (effectively higher thrust and power consumption, but same Isp - this is the principle on which advocates of EP see it as the most efficient feasible propulsion for interplanetary missions).

Due to the particularly non-linear variations with launch date (periodic over 27.5~days based on the Moon's orbit) a good parameterisation of the launch date would be to use two variables, one to increment an integer number of months forwards or backwards, the other a floating point to indicate the number of days either side of the month.

Initially modelled Cruise with 4xPPTs at 1~Hz, took 2298~radians $\Delta$L and about 950~days. Optimisation not possible due to numerical limitations. Modified to 2Hz due to surplus power, simulation took 1347~radians and about 500~days.

Show graphs for low power Cruise phases? 

From the power output, realised that the design could use more power to transfer faster - take many forms. Higher pulse frequency most promising, this linearly increases thrust at exactly the same Isp, at the cost of linearly increasing power consumption. The only limitation is wear and tear to the service life of the thruster; should be proportional to the number of pulses and since each pulse provides a certain Impulse bit, the number of pulses required to perform the lunar transfer should be constant. Thrusters have not been endurance tested yet meaning we don't know how many cycles they can perform. Other constraint is cooling - over about 3~Hz the PTFE is not able to cool properly between cycles and can interfere in the thruster performance. However, some tests performed in Russia (cite Matthias and/or Pedro here?) have successfully used a design similar to SIMPLEX at 20~Hz.

Thrust and power can also be linearly scaled by simply introducing more PPTs to the structure. This has been championed by the PPT designer, Matthias Lau. This option increases the redundancy of the system (and therefore reliability). However, it also carries the associated cost of extra weight.

Finally, extra power can be discharged into each pulse. This increases the Isp and thrust because the plasma is accelerated faster, but the increase is not proportional to the extra power put into each pulse. Therefore the power efficiency drops. Currently the development of the PPTs is focussed on improving the power efficiency, so the performance at this opposite end of the scale is not well characterised/not well known.

\parencite{Cabrera2011}

regardless, it was found that increasing the thrust shortens the transfer but makes lunar capture more difficult. The higher thrust may be targeted at the Moon, and an appropriate orbital energy can be attained for lunar capture (about 5000~m$^2$s$^{-2}$) but due to the higher thrust, a larger proportion of the energy is made up of kinetic energy. In other words, the spacecraft is going too fast to achieve a strong lunar capture, even with a very low lunar pass. Perhaps relative velocity might be a better termination criterion?

\subsection{Substitution of parameters}\label{sub:subst-param}

\autoref{sec:state-vector} establishes the state vector $\vec{x}=[p,f,g,h,k,L,m,t,E]$, and provides the differential equations with respect to time. However, as outlined in \autoref{sub:Independent-parameter}, the normalised true anomaly, $Ln$, was the independent parameter. Therefore a subsitution of parameters is required to give derivatives with respect to $Ln$, $\frac{d}{dLn}$. Differentiating equations \eqref{eq:Ln} results in \eqref{eq:dLndt}.
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:dLndt}
\begin{gather}
\frac{dLn}{dt}=\frac{1}{\Delta L}\frac{dL}{dt} \\
\frac{dLn}{dt}\cdot\frac{dt}{dL}=\frac{1}{\Delta L} \\
\frac{dLn}{dL}=\frac{1}{\Delta L} \\
\frac{dL}{dLn}=\Delta L
\end{gather}
\end{subequations}

Using this identity, the state differential equations with respect to normalised longitude may be determined.

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\frac{dp}{dLn}&=\frac{dp}{dt}\cdot\frac{dt}{dLn}\\
&=\frac{dp}{dt}\cdot\frac{dt}{dL}\cdot\frac{dL}{dLn}\\
&=\frac{\dot{p}}{\dot{L}}\Delta L
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

%The differential equations for $f$, $g$, $h$, $k$ and $m$ are modified similarly to $p$. $L$ is simply $\frac{dL}{dLn}$. Substituting the parameters of the remaining differential equations gives:
%\begin{subequations}
%\begin{align}
%\frac{dt}{dLn}&=\frac{dt}{dL}\cdot\frac{dL}{dLn}\\
%&= \frac{1}{\dot L}\cdot\Delta L
%\end{align}
%\end{subequations}
%\begin{subequations}
%\begin{align}
%\frac{dE}{dLn} &= \frac{dE}{dt}\cdot\frac{dt}{dL}\cdot\frac{dL}{dLn} \\
%&= \frac{P}{\dot{L}}\cdot\Delta L 
%\end{align}
%\end{subequations}
The remaining differential equations are modified similarly. The final equations are presented in \eqref{eq:dLn}.
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:dLn}
\begin{gather}
\frac{dp}{dLn}=\frac{\dot{p}}{\dot{L}}\Delta L \\
\frac{df}{dLn}=\frac{\dot{f}}{\dot{L}}\Delta L \\
\frac{dg}{dLn}=\frac{\dot{g}}{\dot{L}}\Delta L \\
\frac{dh}{dLn}=\frac{\dot{h}}{\dot{L}}\Delta L \\
\frac{dk}{dLn}=\frac{\dot{k}}{\dot{L}}\Delta L \\
\frac{dL}{dLn}=\Delta L \\
\frac{dm}{dLn}=\frac{\dot{m}}{\dot{L}}\Delta L \\
\frac{dt}{dLn}=\frac{1}{\dot{L}}\Delta L \\
\frac{dE}{dLn}=\frac{P}{\dot{L}}\Delta L 
\end{gather}
\end{subequations}
where $\dot{p}$, $\dot{f}$,  $\dot{g}$, $\dot{h}$, $\dot{k}$ and $\dot{L}$ are the original time-domain differential equations provided by \textcite{Walker1985}.

\subsubsection{Delta-v calculation}
The universal definition for delta-v was provided in \autoref{sub:Delta-v}. Unfortunately this definition also depends on time-domain integration. Therefore another substitution of parameters is required.
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\Delta v &= \int^{Ln_f}_{Ln_i}\frac{|T|}{m}\frac{\text{dt}}{\text{dLn}}\text{dLn}\\
&= \int^{1}_{0}\frac{|T|}{m}\frac{\text{dt}}{\text{dL}}\cdot\frac{\text{dL}}{\text{dLn}}\text{dLn}\\
&= \int^{1}_{0}\frac{|T|}{m}\frac{\Delta L}{\dot L}\text{dLn}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

%\section{Oberth effect}
%Thrust more at periapsis, less at apoapsis. Should become more apparent when thrust is not held to $T_{max}$.


% Lunar capture
Even with capture phases provided by arcjet, there is very little thrust available to perform lunar insertion. When simulating the transfer this problem is compounded by the fact that lunar insertion must be predicted very accurately, as simulating a lunar orbit in an Earth-centred frame, or vice-versa, causes the trajectory to periodically appear to move backwards relative to the central body. In other words, the anomaly decreases, which causes computational errors.

review this: Low Energy Motions in the Earth-Moon System, Chaos, and Weak Capture \parencite{Belbruno2007}

aim for a \emph{weak capture} at the Moon. This is a capture where the Kepler energy with respect to the Moon is non-positive and the motion of the particle with respect to the Moon is unstable. Such captures are generally temporary. Weak capture occurs in a special region in phase space about the Moon called the \emph{weak stability boundary}, WSB, rigorously defined by \textcite{Belbruno2004}

\section{Orbital behaviour}

\subsection{Gravitational assists} \label{sub:Grav-assist}

Due to the low thrust of spacecraft \BW, it is expected that a substantial part of the orbit raising will be achieved by exploiting gravitational assists from the Moon. This technique has been well studied, although previous higher-thrust missions did not find it efficient to attempt more than one or two lunar resonances. \textcite{Kemble2006} explains that \enquote{It is possible to utilise lunar gravity to assist in the orbit raising prior to lunar encounter. This takes the form of a \emph{gravitational pumping} effect if the correct phase with respect to the Moon can be established}. He goes on to quantify that \enquote{A typical $\Delta V$ saving of 800~ms$^{-1}$ is obtained by use of lunar gravity assist}. Due to the extended duration of \BW's transit, more lunar resonances should be possible than in a \enquote{typical} scenario, so this should reduce the required delta-v for \BW's ascent from GTO to lunar orbit from 4.1~kms$^{-1}$ to less than 3.3~kms$^{-1}$.

Because lunar gravitational assists provide delta-v without fuel expenditure, they should be implicitly accounted for during optimisation. Preliminary results have already shown this to be the case, as seen in \autoref{fig:Lunar-resonance}. From an initial orbit of 180,000~km (semi-cis-lunar, representing the later stages of the transfer to highlight the lunar assist) the spacecraft takes two orbits to align its phase with the Moon, then receives a very apparent boost purely from the Moon's gravity.

\begin{figure}
\centering
%\includegraphics{}
\caption{Preliminary optimisation showing a lunar resonance implicitly realised by the optimiser.}
\label{fig:Lunar-resonance}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Oberth effect} \label{sub:Oberth}

Regarding the thrust profile, it is well known that thrusting at particular points in the orbit are more efficient than others. \textcite{Kemble2006} once again explains, \enquote{Insertion of coast arcs allows the apogee raising input to be concentrated closer to perigee and hence increase the efficiency of the transfer (in terms of $\Delta V$ required)}. The reason for concentrating thrust near the perigee is known as the Oberth effect: over a period of thrusting, the specific orbital energy gained per unit delta-v exerted is equal to the instantaneous speed \parencite{Oberth1923}. Therefore thrusting is more efficient at high speed, which occurs at periapsis.
 
The resultant effect on the trajectory is that when variable thrust is implemented, the majority of the thrusting should occur near perigee; there should be an inverse relationship between thrust magnitude and orbital radius. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
%\input{Images/thrust-vs-time.jpg}
\caption{Thrust profile during orbit raising.}
\label{fig:Thrust_profile}
\end{figure}

Continuous thrust (tangential to the orbital radius) leads to circular trajectories because an eccentric starting trajectory spends more time at apoapsis than periapsis; hence more thrusting occurs at apoapsis than periapsis. As demonstrated by a Hohmann transfer, thrusting at apoapsis circularises the orbit.

The cycling observed in the figure is due to the elliptical orbit; at apogee and perigee the spacecraft is travelling perpendicularly to its position vector, resulting in a pitch angle of zero. As it travels towards the Earth, it has negative pitch angle, and positive pitch as it travels away again.
 
\begin{figure}
\centering
%\input{Images/pitch-vs-time.jpg}
\caption{Pitch angle during the orbit raising.}
\label{fig:BW1-Pitch}
\end{figure}

As observed in \autoref{fig:Thrust_profile} the thrust of \BW\ is almost constant throughout this simplified scenario. Consequently the traditional parameter for aircraft performance, thrust-to-weight ratio, seen in \autoref{fig:BW1-T/W-ratio}, is dominated by the changing effective weight, as the spacecraft moves closer to the Earth and then away again.

\begin{figure}
\centering
%\input{Images/thrust-to-weight-and-radius-vs-time.jpg}
\caption{\BW\ T/W ratio compared to radial position during the orbit raising. Plot exported from ASTOS.}
\label{fig:BW1-T/W-ratio}
\end{figure}

A spacecraft orbiting the Moon (in the same direction as the Moon orbits the Earth) undergoes a period of low velocity relative to the Earth every time it is on the Earthward side of the Moon. A spacecraft orbiting the Earth in a highly elliptical orbit undergoes a period of low velocity relative to the Earth when it reaches apoapsis, which is conveniently also the furthest point from the Earth, as shown in \autoref{fig:Apoapsis-and-periapsis}. Therefore the trajectory is expected to deliver the spacecraft at apoapsis to a \enquote{stationary point} in the intended lunar orbit, such that the Moon's gravity will then pull it into a steady lunar orbit, avoiding the need for a high-thrust capture maneuvre.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Images/apsides.pdf}
\caption{Apoapsis and periapsis.}
\label{fig:Apoapsis-and-periapsis}
\end{figure}

To maximise the gravitational effect of the Moon on the spacecraft, it should be phase-locked with respect to the Moon's orbit. However, this would require constantly adjusting the orbital line of apsides, which is a high delta-v maneuvre. Gravitational resonance is generally exploited by pointing the apoapsis towards the Moon's ascending node (to remove any dependence on inclination) and adjust the orbital period to resonate with the Moon (that is, the spacecraft completes two orbits to every lunar orbit, or three orbits to every lunar orbit, or five orbits to every two lunar orbits, etcetera). However, based on the unique thrusting constraints of \BW, an alternative optimal scenario may be to maintain the fastest part of the orbit (periapsis) within the Earth's shadow (eclipse), to minimise the amount of time that the craft cannot charge its batteries. In this scenario the spacecraft should also thrust as it passes through the eclipse since it cannot recharge during this time, and thrusting will help it to escape the eclipse as quickly as possible. It will also be interesting to see whether it is optimal to correct inclination, apoapsis or eccentricity first, or whether the optimal solution adjusts all of these parameters simultaneously.
 
% It is well known how to most efficiently control various aspects of an orbit by thrusting at fortuitous times: increasing apoapsis efficiently by thrusting near periapsis, inclination by thrusting out of the orbital plane at apoapsis, and so forth, as anticipated by \textcite{Dachwald2007} in their discussion of optimisation results. \citet{Gao2008} outlines a convenient mathematical model to generate continuous, smooth parameters describing thrust steering, which can easily be used in an optimisation engine.
