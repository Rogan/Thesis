Firstly I would like to thank my principal supervisor Dr Ben Cazzolato for accepting me as his student after Dr Matt Tetlow's departure, bravely taking on a new field of research at the same time. His guidance and support were invaluable to me in finishing this thesis. Thanks also to Dr Vince Wheatley for being my connection with space research during my early days in Adelaide, and of course, thanks to Matt for helping me get started, then lending me his insight and experience in all things optimisation, orbital mechanics, and Stuttgart-related over the course of my work before resuming as my supervisor just in time to review this thesis! Thanks also to the rest of the AIAA Adelaide Section for fostering my dreams of space throughout my university education.

On the other side of the world I'd like to add my gratitude to Prof. Dr Hans-Peter R\"{o}ser for formalising my stay in Stuttgart and providing me with such an incredible international experience, and the opportunity to work on such an ambitious project with such great people. Heartfelt thanks to the recently appellated Dr-Ing. Oliver Zeile for being my main mentor and sounding board in Germany, but moreso for his unflagging enthusiasm and friendship over the past years. I also owe a debt of gratitude to Dr-Ing. Ren\'{e} Laufer for starting the \emph{Kleinsatellitenprogramm} and always being available for long, rambling discussions while I was working on it, but even more for encouraging me to attend the International Space University. A huge thankyou must then go out to the ISU community, for reigniting my motivation and further inspiring me to pursue a career in space.

Big thanks must go to the ASTOS boys, in particular Francesco Cremaschi and Christian M\"{o}llman, for their technical support and assistance with the optimisation software throughout my studies. I really appreciate the time you put in, above and beyond our original agreement.

I wish to thank the Deutscher Academischer Austauch Dienst (DAAD) for financial support during my stay in Germany, and thanks also to the people of The School of Mechanical Engineering at The University of Adelaide, and the Institut f\"{u}r Raumfahrtsysteme at Universit\"{a}t Stuttgart for facilitating my work on such a fantastic project in two top quality research environments. Deserving of special mention are Billy Constantine, for keeping my computer in brilliantly working order in Adelaide, Edgar Schreiber, for trying to do the same in Stuttgart, and Kay Leverett, for her patient guidance through The University of Adelaide's library resources regardless of where in the world I was.

I really could not have finished this project without the support of my friends in Stuttgart and Adelaide, and elsewhere around the world. You guys really gave me the motivation to finish this thing! Here I really have to single out Tristan Williams, for lending many hours of programming expertise remotely from Helsinki. Last but perhaps most importantly, sincere thanks to my family, who have always supported me throughout my studies. Special thanks go to Mum for making me take this task on in the first place, and Dad for looking after Orlando during my lengthy absences\includegraphics[height=0.5mm]{images/homer_simpson.pdf}%
