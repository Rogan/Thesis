\chapter{Conclusion} \label{cha:Conclusion}

In any complex, concave optimisation problem the only way to be certain of an optimal solution is a brute force search. This is of course computationally prohibitive. Luckily, in the context of planetary missions it is not an operational requirement to find the optimal path, merely to find a good path. 

% Findings
\section{Summary of major findings}
initial guess for trajectory perhaps not good. use velocity vector instead of tangent? This will maintain eccentricity, since lunar assist is best at \enquote{circularising} (lunar force will be applied at apoapsis, which will raise periapsis).
Also, if we can focus thrust around periapsis this will generate more delta v according to Oberth effect. This will increase the apoapsis, allowing lunar assists to increase the periapsis.

\section{Additions to \BW\ program} \label{sec:BW1-additions}
power surplus - use higher pulse frequency or additional thruster units - leads to higher approach velocity if orbital energy is used as termination condition, making rendezvous and strong capture quite difficult.

doesn't give a complete, final trajectory
does give a procedure for determining a good trajectory once launch date is known
does give an estimate for the transfer duration and fuel requirements

% Additions to knowledge
\section{Additions to low thrust trajectory optimisation} \label{sec:Optimisation-additions}

high fidelity optimisation is possible using SOCS, just needs better processing - future support for multiple cores, parallel processing. SOCS is currently a direct shooting method - perhaps adapt it to multiple shooting

% Future work
\section{Future work} \label{sec:Future-work}
Further applications of low thrust trajectory optimisation using SOCS and GESOP? IAC2011 paper
try additional thrust profiles, for initial guess sensitivity (basins of convergence), montecarlo for trajectory sensitivity, and of course optimise the whole lot linked together - cruise phase should define descent
use flight angle instead of unit thrust vector (no constraint evaluation required).

parallel processing
optimise whole trajectory together
obviously implementation of real launch date, once that is known

Colleagues working on the project have identified a number of lunar inclinations that reduce station-keeping costs throughout the science phase. \textcite{Zeile2010} recommend a final inclination of 70\degrees, having used an argument of periapsis of 43.3\degrees\ and a right ascension of 285\degrees. This would be easily be achievable using minor course corrections during the arcjet-powered capture phase, or even during the lengthy descent phase with the PPTs. The recent study by \textcite{Gupta2011} reinforces this conclusion, showing that the "transition altitude", that is, the altitude above which a sudden increase in orbital life time is observed, is lowest for a 70\degrees\ inclined orbit (Figure 14a) and provides a range of right ascensions that could be trialled.

future work: try modifying mission architecture (shorter ascent, higher thrust during cruise). Greater power limitations would require more effort in modelling power degradation of the solar panels.


fully optimised (reduced complexity) phase does use thrust-coast-thrust profile. maybe not due to power limitation though - batteries and solar panels sized well enough to not require coasting phases, even during higher energy arcjet phases. Potential to use extra energy for more thrust? Additional energy requirements for communications and payload? Allow for radiation damage


time spent in van allen belts, time on each phase, delta v on each phase, fuel spent on each phase, energy used on each phase

combination of right ascension and departure date can affect power level during ascent phase substantially. unfortunately, both of these parameters are dependent on the launch.


total delta v 
1.3 2.5 1.0 0.4 = 4.2km/s
chemical propulsion GTO-moon usually takes 4.04 (LEO @ Kennedy to LLO) but all of this is applied at LEO, so it benefits from the Oberth affect. (LEO-GTO = 2.5, GTO-LLO = 1.6!!)
LEO-Moon with EP 8km/s

% Comparison SMART-1 \cite{Estublier2002} 82~kg Xe 4958~hours thrust 1540~s average Isp 3.7~kms$^{-1}$

For comparison, the Hall-effect thrusters used by SMART-1 had a total of 9200~hours of ground qualification testing before flight. This is equivalent to over a year of continuous thrusting in a thermal vacuum chamber. Given the anticipated flight duration for \BW, maintaining the same ratio of testing to flight time requires XXXX hours of ground testing before flight.


power efficiency perhaps not critical performance marker for thrusters - plenty of power available. improve thrust! 



% A mission was proposed by Universit\"{a}t Stuttgart to launch a small 200~kg satellite named \BW. This satellite will use a very low-thrust electric propulsion system to accelerate outwards until a proposed rendezvous is made with the Moon.

% This research project aims to find innovative methods to optimise the trajectory of \BW. Given the very low-thrust of its propulsion system, the intention is to judiciously regulate thrusting to adjust the orbital parameters such that the gravitational pull of the Moon contributes substantially to the transfer. Constraints on the thrusting profile result in a high degree of non-linearity throughout the optimisation process, requiring improvement in optimisation methods.
